Hi Houda,

We currently have a POC and some SQL scripts that need to be launched on the database. Could you let us know how you can help with this? Do we need a DBA from time to time to run these scripts, or is there another process we should follow?

We tried running them on our side, but we don’t have the right access/permissions. Any guidance you can provide would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
