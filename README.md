Hello team,

Following our latest discussions and the TO session, here is the update on the cluster decision for the PoC:

We have confirmation that we can proceed using the existing cluster (10xx series) rather than moving to a 2xx cluster.

The 10xx cluster is more cost-efficient for our PoC needs and avoids additional overhead.

In addition, part of the network setup and openings we require are already in place on this cluster, which makes it more practical for us to start quickly.

For the PoC, we will therefore deploy on the 10xx cluster and size the resources carefully to stay within quota. As we progress and the need for additional capacity arises, we will adjust resource allocation accordingly.

This approach ensures we don’t over-consume resources at the start, while keeping flexibility to scale later.

Thanks, and we’ll share further updates as we move into the setup phase.

Best regards,
Amine
