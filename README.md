Hi Arnaud,

We recently updated the SATS (Technical Architecture) for the ROAD project to include the new APIM integration. We need your architectural validation on this first iteration.

Context:
The ROAD APIs are now exposed on the Group Marketplace via the APIM integration in our DEV and QUALIF environments. To proceed with the deployment to Production, we needed to update the SATS to clearly map the connections between the ROAD and APIM ecosystems.

Could you please review the attached updated SATS and confirm if the design works for you? This validation is a prerequisite for creating the Change for the Production deployment and requesting the flow openings.

Don't hesitate to get back to us if you have any questions, or if you prefer to set up a quick sync to review these changes together.

Thanks in advance for your help.
Best regards,

Ahmed Amine CHAKROUN
