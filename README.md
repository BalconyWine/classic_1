Dear Team,

Following our call yesterday, and as part of the ongoing coordination initiated during Wednesday’s FinOps session, I’m summarizing below the deployment scenarios we discussed, as well as the single outstanding action needed before we can move forward.

Deployment Scenarios Presented

Option 1 – Use of the Sandbox on Cluster 246
This remains the preferred scenario, as it would allow us to launch quickly with minimal setup. This is subject to the sandbox being available.

Option 2 – Standard Deployment on Cluster 246
If the sandbox is unavailable, we can still proceed on Cluster 246 by reducing pod CPU requests below 1 vCPU. This approach requires validation of available capacity by TEO.

Option 3 – Deployment on Cluster 1045
This is a fallback scenario, to be considered only if deployment on Cluster 246 proves unfeasible. It would involve a full onboarding and more extended lead times.

Pending Item
At this point, the only remaining blocker is the confirmation from the LATAM networking team regarding the required connectivity. Once this is received, we are fully ready to begin the POC.

Eric (FinOps) will be added in copy going forward to support the coordination and ensure alignment on governance aspects.

Please let us know as soon as your network team has provided their input so we can proceed without further delay.

Best regards,
