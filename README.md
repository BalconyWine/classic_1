Hi Marcio,

I’m reaching out to you on the recommendation of Sorel Mocto.

We’ve been investigating an issue with a Dynatrace synthetic test for the Datafabric GUI in PROD, which is currently failing with a "Connection timeout" error at the SESAME login page. After troubleshooting with Sorel, we identified that TOTP authentication is currently excluded for Datafabric on the PROD console.

Sorel mentioned you are the right person to handle this configuration for SESAME Europe. We already have the explicit approval from Arnaud Vigreux to go ahead and enable TOTP authentication for Datafabric in PROD.

Could you please help us activate this? I can forward you the official approval message from Arnaud if you need it.

Thanks in advance for your help!
