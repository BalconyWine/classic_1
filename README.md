Hello,

I need your help, please. I am currently unable to manage the membership of the following Jira groups required for the project AER_BIZDAIDICA.

I am an admin of the project, but I need the rights to add and remove users within these specific groups. Please grant me "Group Manager" or "Owner" permissions for:

- jira_APS_CARDIF_APS_DAI_users
- jira_APS_CARDIF_APS_Digital_Capabilities_users
- jira_APS_CARDIF_IT_Business_Platforms_users
- jira_APS_CARDIF_IT_Data_AI_users
- jira_APS_CARDIF_IT_Data_AI_viewers
- jira_APS_CARDIF_IT_Digital_Capabilities_users

This is to ensure I can manage my project team effectively. This request is a follow-up to the context in ticket SUP_JIRA-8649.

Thank you.
