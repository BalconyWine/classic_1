Subject: LATAM POC – Deployment Scenarios and Pending Input

Dear Team,

Following our discussion yesterday — and further to the FinOps session earlier this week — here is a consolidated summary of the proposed POC deployment scenarios, as well as the outstanding items we need to move forward.

Deployment Scenarios Presented
Option 1 – Use of the Sandbox on Cluster 246
Preferred option, offering the quickest path forward, pending confirmation of sandbox availability.

Option 2 – Standard Deployment on Cluster 246
If the sandbox is unavailable, deployment is still possible on the same cluster by reducing pod CPU requests below 1 vCPU. This requires capacity validation by TEO.

Option 3 – Deployment on Cluster 1045
Fallback option if Cluster 246 proves unfeasible. Would involve full onboarding and additional coordination.

Current Status and Next Steps
The setup is ready from our side, and we’re aligned on the scenarios above.

However, I still do not have all the necessary accesses to begin work. This remains a blocking point.

We are also awaiting confirmation from the LATAM networking team regarding the required connectivity to proceed.

To ensure full visibility and alignment on the financial side, Eric Loiret (FinOps) will be included in copy on future exchanges related to this POC.

Please let us know once the network validation is complete and access provisioning is confirmed.

Best regards,
