Hello,

Regarding the project backbone, we would like to know the details about the expected volumes this project will require.

Since we will need to inform BP2I about your needs for 2026, could you provide us with the following information:

How many databases will you need, and what size do you expect them to be?

How many servers will be required (if any)?

Do you have an estimate of the CPU and RAM resources that all applications will require?

Thank you in advance.
